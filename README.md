<h1>Flipkart Category Prediction</h1>

This repository was made as an internship selection task for MIDAS lab, IIIT Delhi  

<h2> Cloning the repository </h2>

To clone the repository type <h4>git clone https://github.com/AnantShankhdhar/Flipkart_Category_Prediction.git</h4> in your terminal

<h2> Libraries used </h2>

<h2>The approach has been discussed in detail in the file README.pdf </h2>

Cleaning.ipynb- Used for cleaning the data

LSTM_no_sampling.ipynb- LSTM implementation

LSTM_sampling.ipynb- LSTM implementation with addressing class imbalance

bert2.ipynb- BERT implementation

The following python libraries were used and are required by the classifier:-   
For cleaning and visualization:-   
1)pandas   
2)nltk   
3)spacy   
4)matplotlib   
5)seaborn

2)tensorflow      
3)pytorch    
4)transformers    
5)pandas   
6)numpy   

<h2>Setting up the repository</h2>   
<h3>Setting up cleaning.py</h3>   
1)clone the repository  

2)navigate to the repository on your machine   

3)open jupyter notebook by typing <h4>jupyter notebook</h4>  in terminal 

4)open cleaning.py and run the cells

<h3>Setting up colab notebooks</h3>   
1)go to this drive link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t4Bn81u_3eVVIzSWpxycDWYD_PlretWA?usp=sharing. This file contains all the datasets as well as model files

2)Add the directory shortcut to your personal google drive 

3)open the colab notebook in colab and mount your google drive

4) Run the notebook.Do not run the training cell if you wish to use the trained model directly.Otherwise run all the cells
